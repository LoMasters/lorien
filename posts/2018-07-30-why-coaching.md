I’ve been asked a lot lately why I got into Life Coaching. The truth is: it chose me.

As long as I can remember, I’ve always had a passion for empowering and supporting others. I have the ability to see someone’s gifts and guide them to see what  has been so clear from the start.

For those that don’t know me well, let me share a little bit of my story  and how I managed to empower myself  and eventually discover my purpose.

My whole journey started when I was lucky enough to work for a company for several years. One that drove me to take on so many unique opportunities that opened me up to new experiences. I was encouraged and emboldened to try new things. I was told I could be not only a business owner, but most importantly I was capable to inspire and encourage those around me. The catalyst for inspiring and developing came through the gift of training. The algorithm is pretty straightforward: we break down a set of skills, train, coach, provide feedback, and celebrate wins.

It was my first taste of motivating and coaching others to reach their full potential and I, myself, found that I was becoming fulfilled. So much so, that I knew I needed to find a way to make it a part of  my everyday life.

I embarked on a new quest – how do I make this feeling, this fulfillment a constant? My first thought was counselling, the obvious choice, so I trekked out for a degree. And after two and a half years of night classes, I got it. It was around this time, a mentor asked me if I would consider a  role in HR. This was a less obvious choice, but I was interested.

Specifically, when I realised that the focus of the role would be heavy in training and development: working one on one with passionate individuals seeking growth and fulfillment. I didn’t know if it was exactly what I was looking for, but I did know that I wanted to help people grow and shine. I jumped right in. Before I knew it, I was facilitating one to two day training sessions about giving feedback, presentation skills and leadership.

I realised that I loved standing in front of people, coaching and providing new skills they could take with them. Things were falling into place, and I was so excited by my own self-discoveries. But something still wasn’t quite right. And it took almost a year before it hit me: although I loved helping all these amazing people further their career, I really wanted to empower and support women.

As I’m sure most women have, I struggled with many self esteem issues throughout my life. I remember what it felt like to lose who I was, not knowing what I felt passionate about, feeling like there was no more purpose. It’s an unsettling place to be, and a terrible feeling to have. It was a journey I had to take, and I knew I could guide women to rediscover and fall in love with their unique and beautiful selves.

And here we are, I found life coaching, and you found me.
