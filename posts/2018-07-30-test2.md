# Self Confidence. What’s that? Where can I find it?

When was the last time you felt untouchable? That your confidence was at an all time high, and you felt amazing about who you were, and what you have to offer.

I’ve been exploring this myself recently and i’ve narrowed it down to my golden years. 21-24 I was my best self, my most raw version. I’m not saying that I want to be that exact version of myself again. But I have been putting in a lot of work, to feel that same spark I once had that made me love me unconditionally.

When were your golden years? What about you then do you admire? How did you feel then?

The golden Lo was fierce. I loved myself and the life I had created for myself. I had just moved in with my best friend, I loved my job and I felt free. I had a sense of belonging, I had found my people and I felt safe.

I was free to be 100% myself and excepted, and knowing I had that gave me an unshakable confidence.

I’m almost back there again. I have my tribe, I love what I do and I feel safe. I found my recipe to confidence, and have rediscovered and fell back in love with my authentic self.

Make today the first step to rediscovering you.
