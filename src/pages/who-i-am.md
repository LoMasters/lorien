I am a Transformational Life Coach here to support and empower women to find self-love and rediscover themselves. I am an expert in overcoming the low, thriving on the highs, and  rebuilding  confidence, and a sense of self. With you,  we will unlock  the  hidden thought patterns holding you back in life and leaving you burnt out and uninspired.  You will be empowered  to feel a stronger connection to yourself, so you can regain the excitement and  self-commitment that  makes life wonderful

I know this can be done because I have been there. A few years ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. The anxiety of surviving an abusive relationship years prior began to arise. I had a career that on paper was amazing, however not the one I saw for myself any longer. My mental health and self worth we're at an all time low. Depression and anxiety were consuming my life. I was unmotivated, stuck and and realized I had no passions of my own anymore. I had become so consumed by trying to make everyone else in my life happy, and making them my first priority, that I had lost sight of what made me happy. I realized I hadn’t done anything truly for myself in a long time. I remember waking up one morning and thinking, is this it? Will I not feel bliss again?

It took months of soul searching. It was during a trip in Peru where I started seeing my full potential, and the gifts I had to offer. I realized how much I truly did love myself and that this whole time I already knew what my purpose was, I just hadn’t been able to see it until then.

Most joy in my life came from helping other people. I felt the most fulfilled when I was coaching friends and coworkers at work and in my personal life. This thread has always been there: I am a Certified Counselor, established HR professional, and an expert in Leadership training and speaking. Now as a result of hard work and committed self reflection, I have recognized this inner strength, and am now looking forward to carrying this thread to the future.

I changed my mindset, reset my relationship to myself, and in the process transformed how I related to those that I love. Only once I had healed myself could I heal the way I related to others.I know that it can be easy to get stuck in a negative cycle. Whether it’s believing you’re not good enough, are unworthy of a promotion or a relationship, or undeserving of the life you have dreamt for yourself - I am here to tell you it can be done.

I transformed and learned to challenge and accept myself. Key to this has been freeing myself from the need for others to accept me. With time, dedication, patience, and the help of my incredible mentor I got to where I am today. I know that I will continue to grow and develop if I continue to put myself first. Loving your authentic self - unconditionally, free of boundaries - is the most liberating feeling. I want that for you. You can have the life you have always dreamt of and you can wake up each day so thankful for the life you have. I can help you if you’re willing and able to commit to yourself.

I will be your to guide to transform, and guide you to restore your confidence and courage to live your life to its fullest. Realize and manifest the truth of yourself and the greatness you sense inside you, create an extraordinary life, a way to your freedom, to your truth and your authentic self.
