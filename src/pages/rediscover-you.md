Our lives are a projection of our emotional state. We react to situations and circumstances based on this emotional state, based on our past experiences.

Depending on the experiences you’ve had this can leave you with empowering or disempowering beliefs, that can be broken down into 5 layers.

1. Behavior
2. The Story
3. Emotion
4. The Belief
5. The Original Incident

Rediscover You was designed to help you break down the disempowering layers to help you find the root cause of these beliefs, and how they came to be. From there I can help you rebuild that story so that you can break through your patterns and move forward with a new and empowering belief system.

Example – Suffering from low self-esteem? Together we can find the root cause of this behavior and build it up into a place of self-empowerment and self-love.
